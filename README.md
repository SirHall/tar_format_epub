# What is this?
It is simply the [GNU Basic Tar Format]() page in epub form.

# Usage
`pandoc tar.md -o tar.epub`
or just grab the tar.epub file.

# Note
The `*.epub` file (the build result) is kept in purely because I doubt it'll be that big of an issue for it to remain in the version control history given the infrequent changes, and for 'convenience'.
